    label: "Diagnostics — paper biosensor for CRP",
    hypothesis:
      "A paper-based electrochemical biosensor functionalized with anti-CRP antibodies will detect C-reactive protein in whole blood at concentrations below 0.5 mg/L within 10 minutes, matching laboratory ELISA sensitivity without requiring sample preprocessing.",
  },
  {
    id: "gut_health",
    label: "Gut Health — probiotic in mice",
    hypothesis:
      "Supplementing C57BL/6 mice with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG for 4 weeks will reduce intestinal permeability by at least 30% compared to controls, measured by FITC-dextran assay, due to upregulation of tight junction proteins claudin-1 and occludin.",
  },
  {
    id: "cell_bio",
    label: "Cell Biology — trehalose cryopreservation",
    hypothesis:
      "Replacing sucrose with trehalose as a cryoprotectant in the freezing medium will increase post-thaw viability of HeLa cells by at least 15 percentage points compared to the standard DMSO protocol, due to trehalose's superior membrane stabilization at low temperatures.",
  },
  {
    id: "climate",
    label: "Climate — bioelectrochemical CO2 fixation",
    hypothesis:
      "Introducing Sporomusa ovata into a bioelectrochemical system at a cathode potential of −400mV vs SHE will fix CO₂ into acetate at a rate of at least 150 mmol/L/day, outperforming current biocatalytic carbon capture benchmarks by at least 20%.",
